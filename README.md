YouTube Clone (HTML & CSS with Flexbox)

  This project is a simplified clone of YouTube, created using only HTML and CSS, with a focus on replicating the core structure and layout of the platform. The layout is achieved using CSS Flexbox to ensure flexibility and responsiveness. Key features include:

**Responsive Design**: The layout adapts across different screen sizes, offering a consistent experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

**Navigation Bar**: A top navigation bar that includes links for Home, Trending, Subscriptions, and other sections, similar to YouTube's header.

**Video Thumbnails and Flex Layout**: A flexible arrangement of video thumbnails using CSS Flexbox, showcasing video previews, channel names, and view counts.

**Sidebar Menu**: A vertical sidebar for easy navigation between different sections, playlists, and channels.

**Video Player Layout**: A video placeholder for demonstration purposes, with space allocated for titles, descriptions, and a list of recommended videos.

  This project emphasizes mastering Flexbox for layout control, responsive design, and mimicking YouTubeâ€™s interface with clean, organized HTML and CSS code.
